Pygount
#######

Pygount is a command line tool to scan folders for source code files and
count the number of source code lines in it. It is similar to tools like
`sloccount <http://www.dwheeler.com/sloccount/>`_ and
`cloc <http://cloc.sourceforge.net/>`_ but uses the
`pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_
package to parse the source code and consequently can analyze any
`programming language supported by pygments <http://pygments.org/languages/>`_.

The name is a combination of pygments and count.

Pygount is open source and distributed under the
`BSD license <https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_. The source
code is available from https://github.com/roskakori/pygount.
